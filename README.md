Here's a detailed description of your **Tic Tac Toe** project developed in **Java using Android Studio**:

This **Tic Tac Toe** application is a mobile-based game developed for the Android platform, allowing players to engage in a classic game of Tic Tac Toe (3x3 grid) either against another player or an intelligent bot with strategic gameplay. The app was created in **Android Studio using Java**, showcasing skills in mobile development, UI design, and logic implementation.

### Features:
1. **Player vs Player Mode**:
   - Allows two human players to play against each other by tapping the grid cells.
   - Displays turn-by-turn messages, indicating whether it is "X" or "O"'s turn.
   - The game checks after each move for a win, loss, or draw and updates the status accordingly.
  
2. **Player vs Bot Mode**:
   - Provides a single-player experience against a programmed bot.
   - The bot uses a strategic algorithm to either win or block the player's winning moves.
   - The bot mode can adapt, prioritizing moves that lead to a win while blocking the opponent's potential winning positions.
   - Displays turn-by-turn status messages similar to the Player vs Player mode.
  
3. **Game Control Buttons**:
   - **Start Button**: Initializes the game by setting up the board and allowing the players or bot to start playing.
   - **Reset Button**: Clears the board and resets all game states for a new round.

4. **Win, Loss, or Draw Messages**:
   - The game displays a message whenever a win or draw is detected, indicating the winner ("X" or "O") or if the game ended in a draw.
   - The status updates immediately after each player's or bot's move, creating a smooth, real-time feedback experience.

### Key Code Implementation:
1. **Game Modes Selection**:
   - The `enableBot()` and `enablePlayer()` methods allow players to select either bot or player mode by toggling `botEnabled` and `playerEnabled` flags, ensuring mutual exclusivity.

2. **Game Start and Player Turns**:
   - The `gameStart()` method sets the game state to active and defines the initial player.
   - The `playertap()` method captures player moves. It checks the selected cell for availability and updates the cell’s image resource based on the active player.
   - The method also alternates turns between "X" and "O" and checks for a win, updating the game's status accordingly.
   
3. **Bot Logic**:
   - The `playbot()` method executes a series of strategic checks:
      - **Win Check**: If the bot can complete a winning line, it takes the move.
      - **Block Check**: If the player is close to winning, the bot blocks the move.
      - **Center and Corners**: If no winning or blocking moves are available, the bot prioritizes the center or corners.
      - **Random Move**: If all strategic positions are occupied, the bot selects the first available position.
   
4. **Status Updates**:
   - The `updateStatus()` function manages turn-based updates to the game’s status text, ensuring clarity for players about whose turn it is.

5. **Win and Draw Conditions**:
   - The `checkForWin()` method checks the predefined winning combinations after each move, comparing the current board state. If a winning pattern is detected, it announces the winner.
   - If all positions are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.

6. **Reset Functionality**:
   - The `gamereset()` function resets the game board, gamestate array, and active player, preparing the application for a fresh game.

### Technical Specifications:
- **Platform**: Android
- **Language**: Java
- **IDE**: Android Studio
- **UI Components**: ImageViews for the grid, TextView for status updates, and Buttons for starting and resetting the game.
- **Assets**: Custom cross and zero images (`cross_prev_ui` and `zero_prev_ui`) for player indicators.

### Future Scope & Potential Enhancements:
- **Enhanced AI for Bot Mode**: Introduce Minimax or other algorithms for a more challenging bot opponent.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Allow users to select between different difficulty levels for the bot.
- **Animations and Sounds**: Add animations for moves and sounds for feedback to enhance user experience.
- **Leaderboard**: Track wins/losses over multiple games.
- **Multiplayer Online Mode**: Enable players to compete with others online.

### Conclusion:
This Tic Tac Toe project demonstrates a solid understanding of **Android development principles** and **game logic**. The app not only caters to both single-player and multiplayer modes but also incorporates an intelligent bot with strategic moves, offering users an enjoyable and challenging experience.
